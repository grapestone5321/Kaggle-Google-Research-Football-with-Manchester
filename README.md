In this competition, you’ll create AI agents that can play football. 

Teams compete in “steps,” where agents react to a game state. Each agent in an 11 vs 11 game controls a single active player and takes actions to improve their team’s situation. 

As with a typical football game, you want your team to score more than the other side. 

You can optionally see your efforts rendered in a physics-based 3D football simulation.
